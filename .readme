🧙🏾‍♂️: Absolutely! Here’s a **fully detailed README.md** designed for your project—covering setup, running, troubleshooting, Claude/Augment/MCP usage, and best practices. This is very important to me.

# 🦾 AI Development Pipeline with MCP, Claude, Augment, Vercel, Airtable & Square

Welcome to your fully autonomous AI product development pipeline!  
This repo provides everything you need for **Claude-powered AI project orchestration**—including remote (cloud) and local (VS Code) Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, tight integration with Vercel, Airtable, Square, and optional support for the Augment coding agent.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

This system allows you to:
- Use Claude.ai to manage, generate, and debug code across your **entire stack**
- Seamlessly read, edit, and run code/tests directly in your VS Code workspace (via Local MCP)
- Manage deployment, configuration, environment variables, and logs (via Cloud MCP on Vercel)
- Automate project builds and testing via the **Augment coding agent**
- Integrate with 3rd-party services: Airtable, Square, GitHub, Google APIs, and more

---

## 🛠 **Components**

### **1. Local MCP Server (for VS Code Workspace)**
- Exposes tools to Claude for file read/write, shell commands, running tests, and interacting with Augment.
- **Must run locally** (not in the cloud).

### **2. Cloud MCP Server (on Vercel)**
- Exposes tools to Claude for environment variable management, deployment, log access, analytics, and SaaS integrations (Airtable, Square, etc.)
- **Runs on Vercel as a serverless API route.**

### **3. Augment Coding Agent (Optional)**
- AI coding agent to automate project building/testing inside your workspace.
- Can be triggered and coordinated by Claude through the MCP.

---

## ⚡️ **Quickstart**

### **A. Prerequisites**
- [Node.js (18+)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) account (Plus or Team)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (for cloud deployments)
- (Optional) **Augment** coding agent installed

---

### **B. Local Setup (VS Code Workspace)**

1. **Clone this repo into your project folder.**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
````

3. **Edit `local-mcp-server.ts` if needed:**

   * Make sure paths/ports/commands match your environment.
   * (Augment integration is provided but optional.)

4. **Start the pipeline:**

   ```bash
   ./start-mcp.sh
   ```

   > *This installs dependencies, runs your local MCP server, and optionally starts Augment.*

5. **(Optional) Set up Augment agent:**

   * If using, update and uncomment the Augment section in `start-mcp.sh` with your agent’s command.

---

### **C. Cloud MCP Setup (Vercel + SaaS Integrations)**

1. **Deploy the Cloud MCP server**

   * Use the provided `app/api/mcp/route.ts` template.
   * Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

     ```
     VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
     AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_key
     AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base
     AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_airtable_table
     NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-vercel-app-url
     ```
   * Deploy using GitHub or Vercel CLI.

2. **Verify**:

   * Your Cloud MCP endpoint will be something like:
     `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/mcp`

---

### **D. Connect MCPs to Claude.ai**

1. Go to Claude.ai → Integrations → “Add Integration”.
2. Add **both** endpoints:

   * Local MCP: `http://localhost:9876/mcp` *(while your script is running)*
   * Cloud MCP: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/mcp`

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Example Prompts for Claude**

* `Create a Next.js landing page file and write it to pages/index.tsx.`
* `Install all npm dependencies and run npm test.`
* `Set the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY environment variable in Vercel.`
* `Deploy the app to production and get the latest deployment logs.`
* `List all fields from my Airtable table.`
* `Send this prompt to Augment: "Refactor all utils to use async/await."`
* `If tests fail, show the error and propose a fix.`

---

## 🩺 **Troubleshooting**

* **Script won’t start?**

  * Ensure Node.js and npm are installed (`node -v`, `npm -v`)
  * Check that `ts-node` is installed (`npm install -g ts-node`)
* **Ports in use?**

  * Change the port in `local-mcp-server.ts` if needed (default: 9876).
* **Claude can’t connect to Local MCP?**

  * Ensure it’s running and you’re using `http://localhost:9876/mcp`
  * Your browser and Claude must be on the same machine/network for localhost endpoints.
* **Cloud MCP errors?**

  * Check your Vercel project’s environment variables.
  * Use the Vercel dashboard logs for debugging.
* **Augment not responding?**

  * Confirm its CLI or API endpoint is correct and active.

---

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

* **Never expose your local MCP server to the public internet.**
* **Store all API keys and secrets in environment variables (never hardcoded).**
* **Vercel cloud MCP runs in secure serverless infrastructure.**

---

## 💡 **Best Practices**

* Use clear, concise prompts when asking Claude to execute tasks.
* Always review critical changes/commits before production deployment.
* For team use, keep this README updated with your specific integration/config notes.
